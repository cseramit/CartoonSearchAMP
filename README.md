# CartoonSearchAMP
AMP FED Test

In response to the test, I have created the an angular JS responsive web app.
Once the web page is loaded from the webserver, a REST Call is made to get the list of Cartoon Characters (response is JSON and is mocked at the UI) with each cartoon object having a name and the corresponsing avatar name.
The user is presented with all the Cartoon characters along with the names.

The model is loaded in the view by the controller for the Angular app and the view is loaded. As and when the user types in the search box, the angular filter is applied and only those characters are shown whose name matches with the what the user has entered.

NOTE:- I have taken creative liberty for the images and the character names and not used the images as shown in the assignment snapshot.
